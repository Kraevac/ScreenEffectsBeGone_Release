# 🚀 Modlet Release: Screen Effects Be Gone

This modlet is part of the **DemonataCore** suite.

---

## 📦 Modlet Name
Screen Effects Be Gone

## 🆚 Version
`v1.0.0`  
**Date:** 2025-08-04

---

## 📘 Description

Removes the full-screen tint and haze visual effects that occur when entering hazardous biomes like Wasteland, Snow, and Desert. The biome hazard buffs still apply—but without the distracting or immersion-breaking screen overlays.

Ideal for players who dislike post-processing screen clutter but want to keep the biome challenge intact.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Removes all `onSelfBuffStart` screen tint triggers from biome hazard buffs
- No more red haze, blue blur, or yellow filters while exploring
- Core hazard mechanics (e.g., biome DOT effects) remain fully intact
- Improved visibility and visual clarity across all non-Pine Forest biomes

---

## ✅ Compatibility
- Game Version: 2.0 (or later)
- Compatible with:
  - Vanilla
  - Most overhauls (unless they radically overhaul buff structure)
- Safe to add/remove mid-save (no custom assets or classes)

---

## ⚠️ Notes / Warnings
- This does **not** remove the biome damage or hazard effects—only the screen tints.
- Compatible with other buff mods unless they override the exact same intensity values.

---
